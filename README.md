# Energy_Usage_Prediction
From the Dataset, we have encountered
we have performed Data Preprocessing along with the Exploratory Data Analysis, which is being ideally helped for Visualizing the Data. First we will be dividing the dataset into a train and test i.e.(80% train and 20% test) to avoid the data leakage. And then continuing with the implementation of EDA. 
After the visualizations of resptive data distributions, I have performed scaling or normalizing operations based on respective distribution.
Then used a three different prediction models such as Linear Regressor, Random Forest and Support Vector Regressor, to predict the Energy Usage.

Note: Above Attahced code implementation contains the described methods and operations
